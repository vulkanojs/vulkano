  <h1>It works!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Vulkano, your new favorite MVC framework for node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before getting started, please note: Vulkano is very oppinionated. This means, the Vulkano dev team has setup a
    stack of elements for you to start working rigth away without to much setup. You can change as much as you need.
    It is your project, anyway. Feel free to break things as needed.
  </p>
  <h2>Vulkano defaults</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        For loading views, Vulkano uses Nunjucks by default. Support for ejs is in the box too. To change this setting,
        please refer to <code>app/config/settings.js</code> for instructions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For controllers, Vulkano uses standard Express routes. To configure the routes, go to <code>app/config/routes.js</code>.
        To make things simpler, Vulkano will populate automatic routes to every file in the <code>app/controllers</code> directory
        that follows the following convention: <code>exampleController.js</code>. Replace the <code>example</code> word with anything you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside controllers, name your functions as follows to get automatic routing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>get</code>: default method for the controller for the <code>get</code> http method. If you hit the <code>example/</code> route, it will load the <code>get</code> method. This also works with any http method (you can use <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>delete</code> in the same way).</li>
        <li><code>'get :id'</code>: will load any route that matches <code>example/something</code> and will add <code>something</code> to <code>req.query.id</code>. This also works with any http method (you can use <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>delete</code> in the same way).</li>
        <li><code>'get hello/:id'</code>: will load any route that matches <code>example/hello/something</code> and will add <code>something</code> to <code>req.query.id</code>. This also works with any http method (you can use <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>put</code>, <code>delete</code> in the same way).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To learn more about express routes, go to <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html">https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        For models, Vulkano uses Mongoose. But Mongoose with a twist: if you add Example.js to the <code>app/models</code> folder it will attach all properties and methods to a
        dinamically created Mongoose model. This is for you not to be creating mongoose models again and again and make your workflow a little bit easier by only defining the things
        you need. Of course, this is not bulletproof and you can just create your own 'real' mongoose models anywhere you want.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vulkano happiness bits</h2>
  <p>
    Vulkano also have other tools to make your workday easier:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Services:</strong> allows you build service libraries to use in your project. For example, a tool for automatic email proccessing, or to connect an external API,
        or to modify strings. It's up to you.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Responses:</strong> allows you build your own responses formats. Very usefull to build APIs. By default, Vulkano packages it's own response template called
        VSR (Vulkano standard response), that will fit most needs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Custom configurations</strong>: Inside <code>app/config</code> you can control everything Vulkano. Just poke around. Also, if you need to create your own config files, drop them into
        the <code>app/config</code> folder and access them in your code via the global <code>app.config.yourfile</code> variable. Just make sure you export the data you need in your configuration file.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Front end defaults</h2>
  <p>
    Sure, you will need to change this. We use foundation from Zurb as the default CSS framework for Vulkano, but you can replace it (or remove it altogheter)
    by anything you need.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Serverside HTML templates are located in the <code>app/views</code> folder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can have partials and templates. Combine them to build your views (see Nunjucks or EJS docs to lear more). Checkout the <code>app/views</code> folder to see moore.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Also, <code>app/views/errors</code> you can customize error pages for 500 and 404 status codes for http requests.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your public folder is located at <code>/public</code>. Your compiled styles and JS files will be written there.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you modify sass files in <code>client/scss</code> while runing <code>npm run gulp</code>, your
        styles will be parsed and compiled via Gulp. Browsersync is included in the box.
        Checkout <code>/gulpfile.app.js</code> and <code>/gulp.base.js</code> to make this fit your needs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you modify js files in <code>client/js</code> while runing <code>npm run webpack</code>, your js files
        will be proccessed and packed by Webpack. Please checkout <code>/webpack.app.js</code> and <code>/webpack.base.js</code>
        to see more.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>NPM tasks</h2>
  <p>Vulkano comes with some tasks preconfigured for you in the <code>/package.json</code> file.</p>
